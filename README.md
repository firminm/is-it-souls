## "Is It Souls?" (Website)
Presents users with various videogames that have been given the community tag of "souls-like" on the online video game marketplace Steam and gives them the opportunity to vote yes or no to the question of whether or not they believe the game fits the categorization of "souls-like". Users will be able to view various descriptors/images/trailers about the game in question (via Steam Web API or scraping the store page), as well as a link to the game's store page.
After voting, users are provided with the overall consensus and percentage split between the two answers.


In order to build a userbase and collect data over as long a period of time as possible (prior to website publishing), this project will initially be released as an MVP using the Discord API. 
Building a fully-functioning website will take longer as I will have to learn and become comfortable with the necessary skills and tools, but it remains the final goal.



#### Notes
Final site should have on-hover widget capabilities
